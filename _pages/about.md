# Personal Introduction

<p>I hold a Ph.D. in Engineering, having been jointly trained by China and the UK. I am an Associate Professor, as well as a PhD and Master's Supervisor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University. I am also a member of the Visual Big Data Committee of the China Society of Image and Graphics.<br>

I have been deeply involved in research in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and deep learning, with a focus on visual cognitive computing, intelligent analysis of multimodal images and videos, and medical, remote sensing, and terahertz image analysis. I have led 2 projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation, 1 project by the Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation, 2 key research projects from Anhui colleges and universities, and 1 collaborative innovation project among these institutions.<br>

My academic contributions include over 40 papers published in significant domestic and international academic journals and conferences, and I have been granted several national invention patents. Among my publications are several articles in top-tier journals of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, such as IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, and SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences.<br>

The graduate students I have mentored have achieved notable recognition, including national scholarships, awards for outstanding graduates, the Anhui Computer Society Outstanding Master's Thesis Award, and the Anhui Robotics Society Outstanding Master's Thesis Award.</p>
