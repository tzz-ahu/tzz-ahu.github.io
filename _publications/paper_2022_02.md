**Abstract:** There is an increasing interest in RGBT tracking recently because of the complementary benefits of RGB and thermal infrared data. However, the reliability of each modality will change over time quite possibly, and the modality with bad reliability will disturb tracking performance. Thus, we propose a novel reliability-based feature configuration approach in the correlation filter framework for robust RGBT tracking. Specifically, we configure a feature set based on RGB, thermal, and RGBT data. To measure the reliabilities of different feature configurations, we equip each feature configuration with a tracker and design a guideline judging whether the tracker is reliable. We use the tracker with the best reliability for tracking. Experimental results show that the proposed tracker achieves promising performance against other RGBT tracking methods.
